Vector representations
======================

In NNGeometry, vectors are not just a bunch of scalars, but they have a semantic meaning.

 - :class:`nngeometry.object.vector.PVector` objects are vectors living in the parameter space of a neural network
 - :class:`nngeometry.object.vector.FVector` objects are vectors living in the function space of a neural network
